		<h2>Automation Is Inevitable</h2>

		<p>In "Humans Need Not Apply, it portrays how human jobs are being replaced by robots. Technolody is getting more advanced and robots could now do human jobs much faster. Jobs are now in high demand because they're being taken by automation. Manual labor is no longer needed and nobody's job is safe from being taken over.</p>
		<p>My opinion on automation becoming more advanced is that it's not necessarily a positive thing. The career I want to pursue may not be safe from technology improving and most jobs are not safe.</p>

		<h2>Blown To Bits</h2>

		<p>"Footprints and Fingerprints" talks about how we leave digital tracks everywhere we go unintentionally. Phone camera's bring justice to situations that would've taken a long time to figure out on it's own. Although smartphone cameras can bring justice, they can also bring many false accusations.</p>

		<p>In "The Parking Garage Knows More Than You Think" a man parked his car in the airport garage and did not get his car back for a long time due to his ticket number not matching his license plate. He switched tickets by accident when giving one back to his wife. Who gets access to all your car information?</p>

		<p>In "Convienence of the Customer" big companies are getting data from us by saying they're "being more useful" to the customers. We give out our information to companies so we get suggested products that are related to things we've previously bought. The sites will leave cookies on your previous visits and have your IP address.</p>

		<p>I personally am not a fan of automation prospering this quickly. Although there are many positives to it, it also endangers many occupations. My future occupation may not be safe and I don't think anyones will be.</p>
